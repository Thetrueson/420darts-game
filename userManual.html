        <img src="420darts_image/interpret7.png" alt="">
        <p>(1)Firstly, these three buttons represent winning one dart, two darts, and three darts respectively. When we
            select a button, it will turn red, as shown in the following figure:</p>
        <img src="420darts_image/interpret11.png" alt="">
        <p>(2)Subsequently, we need to click the confirm button, and the corresponding data will be displayed on the
            scoreboard.</p>

        <img src="420darts_image/interpret15.png" alt="">
        <p>(3)If we choose the wrong number of darts, we can click the reset button, which will reset the data of the
            current round, restore the scoreboard to the previous data, and then we can reselect the number of darts we
            have won.</p>
        <img src="420darts_image/interpret16.png" alt="">
        <p>(4)Especially, if none of the darts hit, we can simply click the confirm button. At this point, the three dart
            count buttons will turn blue, indicating that one dart did not hit in the current round and we will receive
            zero points.</p>

        <h3>7.Results Display</h3>
        <p>If 420 points are reduced to less than or equal to 0 within 20 rounds, the game is successful.</p>
        <img src="420darts_image/interpret14.png" alt="">
        <p>If this goal is not achieved within 20 rounds, proceed to the 21st round and can only shoot at the center,
            scoring 50 points per dart. At this point, the user will be prompted to enter the number of darts in the
            21st round. 0 represents missing one dart, 1 represents missing one dart, 2 represents missing two darts,
            and 3 represents missing three darts.</p>
        <img src="420darts_image/interpret12.png" alt="">
        <p>When a number is entered, if the current score reaches the target, the game is successful; if the target is
            not achieved, the game fails.</p>
